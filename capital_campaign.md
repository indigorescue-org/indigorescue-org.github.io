## Capital Campaign Chairman

Do you believe that EVERYBODY deserves a chance to be happy and loved?

Do you think that old dogs deserve to be comfortable and appreciated in their Golden Years–whether they’ve lived a long, hard life or simply out-lived the person who loves them?

Do you have time and energy to invest in an organization that thinks “out of the box” to serve animals that fall through the cracks of the existing animal welfare system?

If you answered yes to these questions, you might be just the person we need!

Indigo Rescue is searching for an out-going, motivated new volunteer board member to serve as our Capital Campaign Chairman. We’re actively developing our working board and we are getting close to our goal of a “brick and mortar” facility, where we can accomplish even more of what we’ve been doing since 1998–in an even more efficient and sustainable way.

The Chair of our Capital Campaign is a key volunteer leadership/board position that drives the efforts to raise initial funding for Indigo Acres, a new property on which a brick and mortar facility will be developed. This position requires networking, management and people skills to get the job done. The rest we can teach you!
