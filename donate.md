It is only with the generous donations of people like you that we can continue our life-saving work. Indigo Rescue is a nonprofit 501(c)3 organization and donations are tax deductible as the law allows.

Be aware that many employers will match your donation up to a certain amount, so please check with your employer to multiply the impact of your gift. A tax receipt will be mailed to you.
