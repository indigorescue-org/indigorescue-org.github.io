## Financial Donation

It is only with the generous donations of people like you that we can continue our life-saving work. Indigo Rescue is a nonprofit 501(c)3 organization and donations are tax deductible as the law allows.

Be aware that many employers will match your donation up to a certain amount, so please check with your employer to multiply the impact of your gift. A tax receipt will be mailed to you.

## Jewelry Donations

More than 20 years ago we fell into a unique fundraising niche for an animal rescue: Jewelry!!  
  
Throughout the year, we receive jewelry donations from generous people all over the country. Everything from fine jewelry and gems to Native American, silver, vintage, rhinestone jewelry and more! We host several jewelry sales each year as fundraisers and 100% of the money raised is used to support our animal rescue efforts.  
  
You may get tired of the jewelry you have, or maybe you're just attracted to a different style. It's the perfect time to donate your jewelry and make room for something new! And jewelry donations to Indigo Rescue are tax deductible. Bling, bling, bling!
