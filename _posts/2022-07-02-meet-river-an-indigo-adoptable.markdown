River is a really sweet, affectionate, good-natured boy Border Collie. He gives the sweetest little kisses with a gentle lick on the nose. River is nervous around new sounds and situations. He gets very anxious in or around cars, but is just fine in an environment that is familiar to him, such as a home and backyard. River is very typically Border Collie in a lot of ways. He is very focused. He would be excellent at nose work and/or agility. He needs just the right kind of very patient adopter.
