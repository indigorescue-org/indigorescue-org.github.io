In 2007, [Indigo Rescue](http://www.indigorescue.org/) purchased an idyllic 16 acre property in Vernonia, Oregon to establish Indigo Ranch, a homestyle, country boarding facility for dogs.  
  
Indigo Ranch is a 16 acre country retreat offering homestyle boarding in the country for dogs. 100% of the proceeds support the lifesaving work of Indigo Rescue, a volunteer based organization that creates and maintains programs to save homeless and abandoned dogs and cats. 
  
Please visit the Indigo Ranch website for your Boarding needs!
